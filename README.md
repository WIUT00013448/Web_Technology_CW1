#### Purpose

This site was created as course work for the Web Technology Module at WIUT by a student with the ID 00013448.

#### About web site

The website of the ESYS company, which specializes in online application development. The site has five pages: home, team, services, career, and portfolio.

#### Project structure

The main page is the index.html file, which is loaded the first time the site is opened. The pages directory contains the rest of the site's pages.
Other site components, like as JavaScript files, CSS files, and images, are kept in appropriate folders within the assets folder.
CSS files are divided into subfolders according to their user:

- Each page has its own folder in the style folder, which contains index.css as the root file and other CSS files based on page sections.
- The Utils category provides CSS files containing fundamental classes for use in projects such as colors, grids, and fonts.
- The Components folder provides more complicated classes for page elements such as buttons, sections, and forms.

Page headers and footers are kept in the root directory's components folder as AppHeader.html and AppFooter files, respectively, and are placed into pages using JavaScript logic by obtaining the content using fetch method and placing it in the main tag.
